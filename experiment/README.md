### Aim: 

To study the effect of force on hemispherical vane and flat plate vane.

### THEORY


When a plate is placed in the path of a jet, the jet exerts a force on the plate. This force can be calculated from the impulse momentum equation. Momentum equation is based on Newton's second law of motion, which states that “The algebraic sum of external forces applied to control volume of fluid in any direction is equal to the rate of change of momentum in that direction." The external forces include the components of the weight of the fluid and of the forces exerted externally upon the boundary surface of the control volume.

If a vertical jet moving with velocity V is made to strike a target, which is free to move in the vertical direction, then a force will be exerted on the jet by the impact of jet. According to momentum equation, this force must be equal to the rate of change of momentum of the jet flow in the same direction.

Due to impact of the jet on the flat stationary plate, the entire velocity of the jet is destroyed and due to the rate of change of momentum, force acts on the plate. The jet after striking will move along the plate. But the plate is at right angles to the jet. Hence the components of the velocity of the jet in the direction of the jet after striking it will be zero. The force exerted by the jet on the flat plate in the direction of the jet.

### Actual Discharge (Qa)

The water flowing through the section of a pipe or a channel under the steady state conditions is collected in a collecting tank for a known time t. The rise of water level in the collecting tank is noted down. The actual discharge is

### DESCRIPTION

The setup consists of a sump tank with centrifugal pump to circulate water. A chamber with two side glass is provided for visualization of impact of jet on vanes. Water from sump tank flows through a nozzle and strikes vertically to vane positioned above the nozzle. Two types of vanes are provided that can be fixed one at a time. Arrangement is made for the movement of the plate of the vane under the action of the jet and also because of the weight placed on the loading pan. Measuring tank and stop watch is provided for flow measurement.



### PROCEDURE

1.	Close all the valves.
2.	Fill sump tank ¾ with clean water and ensure that no foreign particles are there. 
3.	Open by-pass valve.
4.	Ensure that ON/OFF switch given on the panel is at OFF position.
5.	Switch on the main power supply and then switch ON the pump.
6.	Open flow control valve and allow water to flow through test section by partially closing valve.
7.	Open the air release valve provided on the manometer, slowly to release the air from manometer.
8.	When there is no air in the manometer, close air release valve.
9.	Set the position of pitot tube at the centre of the test section by adjusting the pointer to zero by knob provided.
10.	Adjust water flow rate with the help of control valve and by pass valve.
11.	Record the manometer reading.
12.	Measure the flow of water, discharged, using stop watch and measuring tank.
13.	Repeat the experiment for different flow rates of water by operating control valve and by-pass valve.
14.	Record the manometer reading for different position of pitot tube at particular discharge for determination of velocity profile.


### RESULTS

Rate of change of momentum for flat plate vane = ________ N
<br>
Rate of change of momentum for hemispherical vane = ________N


### PRECAUTIONS

1.	Never run the apparatus if power supply is less than 180 volts and above 230 volts.
2.	Always use clean water.
3.	To prevent clogging of moving parts, run pump at least once in a fortnight.
4.	Drain the apparatus completely after experimentation.
5.	Always keep apparatus free from dust.
